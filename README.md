This repository is created for the PDSA course work. This includes 5 minigames created by using the data structures and algorithms.

### 🎮 Mini Games Project

🧠 I contributed to [pdsa-mini-games](https://github.com/ShenSudara/pdsa-mini-games), a Java-based project including 5 classic puzzles and AI-powered games like:

- ✅ Tic-Tac-Toe (Minimax & Alpha-Beta)
- 🗼 Tower of Hanoi
- 👑 Eight Queens
- ♞ Knight’s Tour
- 🗺️ Traveling Salesman

Check it out and see my algorithms in action! 💻✨
